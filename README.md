*Feel free to star and fork this repository if it helps you*

### Goals

Obviously, a Brick Breaker game doesn't need to have a complex abstraction as described in this project.

It's just a project to learn and practice some design patterns based on [Refactoring Guru](https://refactoring.guru/design-patterns) approach.

Here you can see some design patterns like: Factory, Observer, AbstractFactory, etc. 
It can be helpful to visualize applications using design patterns in a "concrete way", since some examples found in books can be very abstract.

### How to Play

* Clone the repository and open ```index.html``` inside a browser.
* Use **←** and **→** or *A* and *D* to move bar to left and right, respectively.
